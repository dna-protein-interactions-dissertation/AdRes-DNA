# AdRes-DNA
An adaptive resolution model for DNA-protein interactions based on the simple Rouse model.

This code is written in Fortran 90 and is inspired by the paper 'Varying the resolution of the Rouse model on temporal and spatial scales' by Rolls, Togashi & Erban. 

The main program AdRes is dependent on a pseudo random number generator available at http://www.netlib.no/netlib/random/random.f90
